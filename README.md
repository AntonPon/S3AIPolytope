# S3AIPolytope

This is a project that helps to work with the polytopes that correspond to the neural network's linear regions at the input space.
By using code from the project, one can:
- calculate polytope that contains a pre-defined point from the input space;
- check if the calculated region is bounded or not. 

To start the project:
1) Install dependencies:
```shell
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2) Run main.py file to run the project: 
```shell 
$ python main.py
```
